__*Before the Fall*__

Night encroached upon the streets of New Borneo. The hustle and bustle of daytime traffic had died down, replaced by the static droning of ancient neon signs, and the vibrating patter of a rolling thunderstorm. Somewhere on the outskirts of the city, a different set of acoustics took the lead.

The distinct blasts of a faulty tailpipe. The powerful roar of an overtuned engine. 

In between the ancient ruins of a defunct civilization, a group of monkeys stood gathered around their makeshift vehicles. Worn-down signage on the derelict buildings nearby indicated this used to be an industrial area, or so the Old World Cult claimed. Who knew whether those fanatics could read these ancient languages anyway?

The four vehicles on this empty stretch of road could not be any different from the muted brownish-green tones of their surroundings; they looked like they were machinated from raw chaos, their chassis adorned by mismatching neon strips and crudely painted stripes. Their headlights illuminated the gilded studs of a surly-looking authority figure, which made for a stunning display.

"We're not losing to those technology-obsessed freaks again. Hit the inner lines on the corners, don't give 'em an inch." Addressing the raggedy band of leather clad simians was the Pack Leader.

"Tonight we show those bastards ya can't beat raw power."

A set of cheerful howls echoed off the nearby buildings as the primates took their seats. The Pack Leader got into her car, a faithful replica based on an ancient pamphlet preserved in one of the Cult's many archives. The main body was covered in a deep metallic purple hue, while a gradient of cyan and magenta neon ran the length of the vehicle. A "Viper", the old civilization had called it. 

With the thunderous sound of ten cylinders firing at ludicrous speeds, she sped off across the rain soaked tarmac, certain of her impending victory.
